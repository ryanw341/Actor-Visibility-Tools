# Actor-Visibility-Tools

This tool adds two options under the prototype token's "appearance" tab.
<br>
The first is a minimum distance option; if no player tokens exists within the range the token is automatically hidden. Perfect for small details that can't be seen from far away.
<br>
The second is a stealth on creation tool designed to be used in tandem with the "Stealthy" module. When enable the token rolls a stealth check automatically when dragged onto a map.
